# **Stroke Prediction Model**


This project aims to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring in patients based on various medical features using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset includes features such as age, average glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, and other factors that are believed to influence the occurrence of a stroke. The goal is to preprocess the data, apply the Logistic Regression model, evaluate its performance, and provide actionable recommendations based on the results.

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on health data. We focus on Logistic Regression, a widely used classification model for binary outcomes like stroke prediction. The project also covers the entire machine learning workflow: data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and providing recommendations based on the results.

## **Key Features:**
- **Dataset:** Contains data on age, average glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, and other health factors.
- **Model:** Logistic Regression used for binary classification (stroke or no stroke).
- **Evaluation:** Precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and confusion matrix are calculated and analyzed.
- **Recommendations:** Discusses handling class imbalance and exploring other model improvements.

## **Key Steps in the Project**

### **1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

### **2. Logistic Regression Model**
- Train the Logistic Regression model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using the following metrics:
    - **Accuracy:** Percentage of correct predictions.
    - **Precision:** True positives / (True positives + False positives)
    - **Recall:** True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
    - **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    - **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### **3. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate the model's performance using precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
- Investigate the confusion matrix to understand how the model performs in detail.
- Explore areas where the model performs well and identify its weaknesses.

### **4. Bias in Dataset**
- **Class Imbalance:** Discuss the imbalance between stroke and non-stroke cases in the dataset.
- **Handling Class Imbalance:** Suggest techniques such as oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling to address class imbalance.

### **5. Mathematical Concepts**
- **Logistic Regression:**
    - **Sigmoid Function:** Models the probability of a binary outcome. The logistic function is used to output probabilities.
    - **Cost Function:** Measures the error between predicted and actual values.
    - **Gradient Descent:** Optimization technique used to minimize the cost function and find the best coefficients for the model.
    - Visual representations of formulas like the sigmoid curve and confusion matrix are included for better understanding.

### **6. Observations and Recommendations**
- **Feature Importance:** Analyze which features significantly impact the prediction of stroke.
- **Model Improvements:** Recommendations on improving model performance, such as:
    - Handling class imbalance more effectively (SMOTE or undersampling).
    - Trying more complex models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
    - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## **Usage**


### **1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script**
- To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook file `(.ipynb)` or run the Python script `(.py)`.

### **2. Data Loading**
- The dataset is loaded using pandas from the provided CSV file `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`.

### **3. Train the Logistic Regression Model**
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- The Logistic Regression model is trained using the training data.
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix) are calculated and displayed.

### **4. Evaluate and Visualize**
- The evaluation results (including the confusion matrix and classification report) are visualized using matplotlib.
- The confusion matrix is plotted for easier interpretation of the model's performance.

## **Output**
